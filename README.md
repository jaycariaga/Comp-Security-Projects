# Comp-Security-Projects
<h1>Welcom to my Project sets and assignments from Computer Security. My projects cover: </h2>
<br />

1. Basic Access Control Mechanisms using Python with a choice of data storage. In this case, I decided to use JSON for easier parsing
2. Overriding Linux's directory printing function "readdir" thru the LD_PRELOAD mechanism using C.
3. Implementing a byte-size version of encryption rather than string, using 3 different ciphers: Binary Vignere, Stream, and Block Encryption with cipher block chaining and padding
<br />Quick Note that the cipher block chaining component has not yet been completed...
4. Emulating a simpler version of Bitcoin's Proof of Work algorithm in Python. Uses sha256 encryption with an algorithm meant to randomly find a leading string that when encrypted follow 
a leading zero requirement based on user input.
